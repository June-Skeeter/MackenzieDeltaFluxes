## Introduction: My Background


I specialize in measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange in permafrost environments.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}

* PhD in Geography from UBC in 2023
* I started as a research scientists with the GSC in summer 2024
  + "Cross posted" between GSC Northern and Pacific

## Framing the Problem

The Arctic is warming ~3x faster than the global average.

## Carbon-Climate Feedback

Climate change is shifting the carbon balance of the Arctic, which has far reaching global implications.

## Importance of Methane

## A Methane Hot-spot

The Mackenzie River Delta is hot-spot for methane in the Canadian Arctic.

* Aircraft and satellite have detected significant methane emissions

## Biologic Emissions

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=65%}

The limited field based measurements available suggest of substantial growing season emissions over where permafrost is continuous.

## Geologic Methane

In discontinuous permafrost, some gas seeps are visible to the naked eye!

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}

* More work is needed:
  + Map sources
  + Quantify emissions
  + Identify potential remediation strategies

## How do we measure emissions?

Eddy covariance (EC) is a principal method to monitor landscape-scale fluxes.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}

* Measures wind velocity and gas concentration at high frequency (20 Hz)
* Gives a semi-continuous time series of half-hourly fluxes

## Limited Observations

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}

EC systems are expensive, difficult to operate in remote environments, and require meticulous analysis.

+ Bias towards accessible sites
+ Canadian Arctic is under-represented

Objective is to help understand emissions in the area associated with biologic production and diffuse geologic emissions.

## Analysis

Eddy covariance produces large volumes of data which are requires complex, computationally expensive processing.

* This poses a significant challenge to researchers.
  + Only ~10% of EC sites in Canada have published open-access datasets.

* I am collaborating on an open-source data processing pipeline with other Canadian researchers.


## Next steps

Installing upgraded sensors and upgrading the power system to support non-growing season measurements.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}

* 2024 was an exploratory campaign conducted using borrowed sensors.  
* 2025 will be run using GSC sensors.

## Further work



Target point-source hot-spots in the surrounding area.

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}

* Site can serve "anchor point" for more spatially targeted investigations.
  * Natural and disturbed areas
